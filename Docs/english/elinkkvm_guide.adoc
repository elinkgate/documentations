== About eLinkGate
'''
eLinkGate is a company whose aim is to help people learn
about IT. eLinkGate has patented a technology called eLinkMe â€“ a USB
device that allows an IT expert to remotely access a computer, smart
phone or tablet to fix any problem the user may have. Our eLinkMe
technology has the following advantages

- *Simple*: No pre-install software or hardware required
- *Smart*: Ability to work when there is no OS (works at BIOS level)
- *Safe*: Protects user data and service provider data

It is our belief that the eLinkMe technology, as well as our future
technologies will enable users to easily request online
service. Inexperienced users who lack sufficient knowledge about
computers such as farmers, housewives and the elderly can also begin
to find support that will make their life better. eLinkMe can also
assist service providers in providing more services online, while
allowing customers to review their results face to face, without
worrying about online theft.

== Introduction
'''
=== Overview
A KVM switch (an abbreviation stands for **K**eyboard, **V**ideo and
**M**ouse") is a hardware device that enables a user to control
multiple computers from one or more sets of keyboards, video monitors,
and mice.

****
.KVM SWitch interworking
image::../../Resource/Kvm-switch-diagram.svg[]

The computer on the right is currently being controlled by the
peripherals. Only one set of keyboard and mouse is required to control
multiple computers, each connected to a monitor. A user can switch
between each monitor to see the output of each connected computer (to
that monitor).
****

Normal KVM switches attach controlling and controlled devices directly
to itself. In contrast, KVM over-IP switches, provides over-the-internet
functionality. This means, instead of physically connected to a KVM
switch through very long cables and are usually limited in a room, a
floor or a building, the controlling devices can be anywhere in the
world that can connect to a KVM over-IP switch and control the connected
computers with a normal Internet connection.

Another approach for remote controlling is using pure software. However,
as a pure software solution is usually limited only in an operating
system environment. Without an operating system, a software solution is
infeasible. Unlike software solutions for remote controlling, a hardware
solution like a KVM switch can be used as a replacement for a computer
monitor. This diagram demonstrates the scope difference between a
software and a hardware solution:

.Hardware and Software remote control scopes
image::../../Resource/RemoteAccessTechnology.png[]

eLinkKVM is one of such KVM-over-IP devices. However, unlike other
KVM-over-IP solutions that are solely hardware solutions, eLinkKVM
takes on a unique hybrid approach that combines both hardware and
software.  While being a hardware solution similar to other
KVM-over-IP switches, but unlike other KVM-over-IP switches, eLinkKVM
takes a step further with its patented technology called
`*Booster*`. `*Booster*` is a software solution that works together
with eLinkKVM hardware to uplift processing performance by utilizing
computing resources of the remote hosts.  `*Booster*` is not limited
to an operating system environment, but also in BIOS and UEFI
environments.

Operators can monitor and access their computers from remote locations
using a remote control software. An eLinkKVM device connects to a local
area network or directly to a personal computer (PC) using a standard
ethernet cable, then uses a USB cable and a video display cables to
connect to a server and complete control it with Keyboard, Video and
Mouse functionality from the eLinkKVM device.

Because the eLinkKVM uses the Internet as its data communication medium,
the server it is connected to can be accessed from any authorized
computer across the Internet, regardless of physical location.

A user at a remote location connect to the eLinkKVM via its IP address.
Once a connection has been established and authorization granted, the
remote computer can exchange keyboard, video and mouse signals with the
remote server (of which the eLinkKVM is attached to), just as if they
were physically present and working on the equipment directly.

=== Booster technology

`*Booster*` is a patented technology that allows eLinkKVM to utilize
computing resources from remote hosts to improve remote
performance. To quickly summarize, `*Booster*` includes software agents
that work on major OS platforms (Windows, Linux and Mac OS)
however,unlike traditional software solutions, `*Booster*` agents can also
operate in BIOS and UEFI environments, independent of any operating
system.

These software agents are installed on remote hosts to utilize the extra
computing power on the remote hosts to accelerate screen data processing
without affecting performance. This enables higher quality remote screen
and more responsive interactions with the remotely remote hosts.

`*Booster*` also helps reducing the loads on eLinkKVM devices, making
eLinkKVM devices run cooler and extend the longevity of eLinkKVM
devices, while delivering higher performance.

The following diagram shows the scope covered by Booster:

.Booster operating scope
image::../../Resource/BoosterModeDiagramFlow.svg[image]

=== Features

The eLinkKVM is designed to help the IT person remotely operate the
Server in most responsive and efficient way. The device is not only
allowing remotely access at Bios Level which is similar traditional KVM
over IP but also adding more features:

Full Bios-level control over an IP Network::
The video capture hardware (Hardware mode) is designed to decode the
video signal up to 1920x1080 that help to monitor the screen in any
situation.

Patented Booster technology::
Faster and higher resolution with `*Booster*` technology, a patent
technology allows monitor the screen with faster transfer, any video
resolution with just a USB connection for almost any situation. See the
`*Booster*` chapter for more information.

Featureful native client software::
Client software is bundled with many unique features: scripting and
image recognition, to automate manual operations. See the eLinkViewer
chapter for more information.

Virtual Media support with 8GB Internal Flash or 64GB with SD Card::

Instead of using a separate computer as a share network storage to
emulate the Virtual Media, eLinkKVM itself is a high performance shared
network storage device.

USB-Powered Design::

The power is getting from USB port of Server, no external power supply
required

RS232 Serial Port::

For Serial Console, Remote Dial In or control external PDU

Built-in IPMI (Intelligent Platform Management Interface) utility::

eLinkKVM understands IPMI and allows control the server that support
IPMI interface. The user may power on/off/reset server without using an
external PDU

Support USB Host Interface::

The USB Host port allow eLinkKVM control the USB 3G/4G, external USB
storage or USB security device to add more functionality.

Flexible Two Ethernet Ports::

The Ethernet ports can be configured to work independently to connect 2
different networks with the master port can be configured as a DHCP
server. Or 2 ports can be used to connect a server to a router, using a
single server Ethernet port.

Built-In USB Hub::

Physically emulate all USB device (Mouse, Keyboard, Storage) with just
one USB cables

Scalability::

eLinkKVM can scale to control more than one computers by connecting the
computers to eLinkSwitch.

Compact form factor::

=== eLinkKVM Physical Connections

eLinKVM can be flexibly setup to connect between a remote terminal and a
remote host with many options.

To connect a remote terminal over IP, the following methods can be used:

* Connect eLinkKVM directly to a router. A remote terminal then can
access eLinkKVM over the Internet.

* Connect eLinkKVM directly to a USB 3G/4G. A remote terminal then can
access eLinkKVM over the Internet.

* Direct connect eLinkKVM to the remote terminal. A remote terminal then
can access eLinkKVM with a direct connection, Internet is not required.

After setting up, eLinkKVM is ready to be accessed by a remote terminal.

To connect a remote host to an already connected eLinkKVM device, the
following methods can be used:

* Connect a VGA cable between the remote host and eLinkKVM to capture
the host screen.

* Using a RS232 cable to capture its serial output.

* Connect the remote host to the Slave port on eLinkKVM to manage
through IPMI interface.

After phsyical connections on both ends are done, a remote connection is
up and running.

== Booster
'''

`*Booster*` is a patented technology for eLinkKVM and related ElinkGate
products. `*Booster*` includes software agents for each major OS platform
(Windows, Linux and Mac OS) that are installed on controlled computers.
When an eLinkKVM device is attached to a controlled computer, the
installed software agent is activated to cooperate with a eLinkKVM
device using a specialized proprieteray protocol. The software agent
then utilizes the available computing resources on the remote host to
greately accelerate video input and output processing. As a result,
eLinkKVM can deliver higher performance at higher resolutions for an
extremely economical price.

To enable `*Booster*` techonlogy, a user only needs to install the
accompanied software components on an existing operating-system
installation. For a fresh computer that need a new operating-system
installation, a tool called `elinkSetuptool` is provided to help
creating install disk images with embedded `*Booster*` from existing
installation ISO files, which is covered in the next chapter.

These disk images can be loaded on eLinkKVM internal storage for remote
operating-system installations on new computers with `*Booster*` enabled
through the whole installation process. After the installation process
is done, the freshly installed operating system is also pre-installed
with `*Booster*` software to allow a user to continue using `*Booster*` without
any interruption.

Once a `*Booster*` agent is installed on a respective operating system,
simply click the `*Booster*` icon to start getting remote screen with
Booster.

Screen quality may improve slightly or significantly compared to VGA
hardwrae mode, depends on the quality of the VGA cable. Remote keyboard
and mouse interactions become much more responsive.

=== Booster Configuration

To make it convenient to switch between `*Booster*` and other modes,
eLinkViewer allows a user to customize Auto `*Booster*` Toggle button.
Pressing this button allows a user to switch between a pre-configured
Booster mode and the current mode.

.  From `ELink Configuration` select a remote display mode.
.  Similarly, select a Key mode
.  Next, select a Mouse mode
.  Select `Base` to confirm configuration. This configuration is used
whenever `Auto Booster Mode` button is clicked.

=== Booster for Windows

Follow these steps to install and use `*Booster*` on Windows:

- Logged into the computer to be a remote host.
- Download `setup_elinkagent.exe` on the website.
- Click the exe file, follow the installer instructions to install the agent.
- After the installation, run `elinkserver.exe` to enable `*Booster*` on the remote host.
- On the remote terminal, connect the remmote host with `eLinkViewer`.
- Click `Elink Configuration` -> `Browse` then select  `A:\floppy.hdd2`.
- Clicking `*Booster*` to activate remote with Booster.

=== Booster for Linux (Non supported yet)

Follow these steps to install and use `*Booster*` on Linu:

- Logged into the computer to be a remote host.
- Download setup package for a distro, .e.g. `.deb` for Ubuntu, `.rpm` for Fedora.
- Install the packages.
- On Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install elinkagent.deb`
- On Feodra: `sudo apt-get install elinkagent.rpm`

- After the installation, run `elinkserver` to enable `*Booster*` on the remote host.
- On the remote terminal, connect the remmote host with `eLinkViewer`.
- Click `Elink Configuration` -> `Browse` then select  `A:\floppy.hdd2`.
- Clicking `*Booster*` to activate remote with Booster.

=== Booster for UEFI

By default, when installing the setup packages for an appropriate
operating system, `*Booster*` is also installed for UEFI
boltloader. Whenever an operating system enters a non-graphical
environment in UEFI, `*Booster*` can be used without any restriction.

=== Embbed Booster into operating system setup images with eLinkSetupTool

`*Booster*` can run in a setup environment of an operating system
when it is being installed on a computer. To use this feature, the
setup disk images must be recreated with an appropriate `*Booster*`
agent embedded, using `eLinkSetupTool`, a disk creation image
tool. `*Booster*` is enabled as soon as the setup image is loaded by
the remote host computer.

==== eLinkSetupTool instalation

On Windows::

* Download `setuptool.exe`.
* Click the installer and follows the instructions.

On Ubuntu::

* Download `setuptool.deb`.
* Install it:

[listing]
sudo apt-get install setuptool.deb

On Fedora::

* Download `setuptool.rpm`:

[listing]
sudo dnf install setuptool.rpm

After the installation, `vfimg` command should be available globally to be used in a terminal program, e.g. `cmd.exe` on Windows.

NOTE: the setup files is above, e.g. `setuptool.exe` should be clickable
to download

=== eLinkSetupTool usage
==== Create OS setup image

To create a new disk image, simply run the following command:

[listing]
vfimg /create-image Win2012.hdd2 /iso Win2012.iso

The command produces the following output:

----
Initializing environment...Done.
Start Analyzing image...Found a Windows 2012 ISO. Done
Format HDD image to FAT32...Done.
Generate elinkme_dummy.dat...Done.
Copy files from ISO to HDD...Done.
Installing vfservice to boot.wim...Done.
Installing vfservice to UEFI...Done.
Generate Embedded Hddx at the end of HDD file...Done
----

The above command creates a new image `Win2012.hdd2` with `*Booster*` agent embedded from the original Windows setup image `Win2012.iso`.

Once the new image is created, upload it to eLinkKVM with `File Transfer`. To use the new image::

- Click `Elink Configuration` -> `Browse`.
- Browse to the uploaded `Win2012.hdd2` and select it.
- `Win2012.hdd2` is now exposed to the remote host computer as a USB drive and is selectable as a boot device in the BIOS.

==== Create a minimal floppy image

eLinkKVM is already bundled with the minimal image `floppy.hdd2` in its interal storage that can be mounted as a floppy disk drive.
For some reason, if the disk is deleted, a user can recreate and reupload the image. To create the floppy image, run the following command:

[listing]
vfimg /make-floppy floppy.hdd2

==== Install UEFI Booster agent to an existing disk image

Aside from OS setup images, there are disk images that contain
troubleshooting tools running in the UEFI environment. To create
new images with UEFI `*Booster*` agent, run the following command:

[listing]
vfimg /install-uefi img.hdd2

==== Display version information:

To show the current setuptool version, run the following command:

[listing]
vfimg /version
